492. Construct the Rectangle

A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.

Example 1:

Input: area = 4
Output: [2,2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
Example 2:

Input: area = 37
Output: [37,1]
Example 3:

Input: area = 122122
Output: [427,286]

var constructRectangle = function(area) {
    let result = [area, 1];

    for (let i=2;i<area;i++) {
        const rest = area%i;
        if (rest !== 0) {
            continue;
        }
        const a = area/i;
        if (Math.abs(a-i) < Math.abs(result[0]-result[1])) {
            result[0] = a;
            result[1] = i;
        }
    }

    return result;

//console.log(constructRectangle(37))
